Biology is the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments. It encompasses a wide range of topics, from genetics and evolution to ecology and microbiology. Biologists study the diversity of life forms on Earth, from single-celled microorganisms to complex multicellular organisms, and the processes that govern their existence.
