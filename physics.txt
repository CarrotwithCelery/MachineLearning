Physics is the fundamental science that seeks to understand the behavior of the physical universe. It deals with concepts such as motion, forces, energy, and matter. Topics in physics include classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and the theory of relativity. Physics plays a crucial role in our understanding of the universe, from subatomic particles to the cosmos itself.
