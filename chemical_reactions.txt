Chemical reactions are the processes by which substances are transformed into new substances through the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. These reactions are governed by the laws of chemistry and can be classified into various types, such as synthesis, decomposition, combustion, and redox reactions. Understanding chemical reactions is essential in fields like chemistry, biology, and materials science.
