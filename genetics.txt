Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on the study of genes, heredity, and genetic variation in living organisms. It explores the mechanisms of inheritance, DNA structure and replication, gene expression, and genetic mutations. Genetics plays a crucial role in fields like medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology, as it provides insights into the genetic basis of traits and diseases.
